# Project Title: title here (10 words maximum)

### Statement
Describe your project. Why is it interesting? Why is it interesting to you personally? What do you hope to learn? 

### Analysis
Explain what approaches from class you will bring to bear on the project. Be explicit: e.g., will you use recursion? How? Will you use map/filter/reduce? How? Will you use data abstraction? Will you use object-orientation? Will you use functional approaches to processing your data? Will you use state-modification approaches? A combination?

The idea here is to identify what ideas from the class you will use in carrying out your project. 

### Data set or other source materials
If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload it from a website? access it in a database? create it in a simulation you will build....)

How will you convert that data into a form usable for your project?  

Do your homework here: if you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materails, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
Explain exactly what you'll have at the end. What will it be able to do at the live demo?

What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

### Evaluation of Results
How will you know if you are successful? 
If you include some kind of _quantitative analysis,_ that would be good.

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
What additionally will be done in the last chunk of time?

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

**Additional instructions for teams of three:** 
* Remember that you must have prior written permission to work in groups of three (specifically, an approved `FP3` team declaration submission).
* The team must nominate a lead. This person is primarily responsible for code integration. This work may be shared, but the team lead has default responsibility.
* The team lead has full partner implementation responsibilities also.
* Identify who is team lead.

In the headings below, replace the silly names and GitHub handles with your actual ones.

### Susan Scheme @susanscheme

### Leonard Lambda @lennylambda

### Frank Functions @frankiefunk

# Project Title: Visual Data
### Problem Statement
When looking at large amounts of data it is sometimes hard to visualize the big picture of whats really going on. 
Lets pretend that you own a car dealership and want to know what months typically have the largest sales. To find out
the answer to this many years of car sales would need to be analysed. This task would be daunting to accomplish without
the help from some clever software. This is interesting because the concept can be applied to many real life situations
where data needs to analysed and viewed graphically to be understood.  

### Problem Analysis
To accomplish this project many concepts from class will be used together to organize, calculate, and display our data.
- A database will be used to store and organize the data that will be used. 
- Mathmatical procedures will be writting to perform the statistcal computation. 
- The plot library will be used to display the data stored in the database. 
- Other methods will be written to import data from an outside file that will be used to fill database. 

### Data set or other source materials
The data we use will come from a file like a excel sheet we create. This file will simulate the data that could be received 
from other sources like the internet. For building and testing purposes we need the data to be fixed and predictable so that is why 
we decided to create our own data set.

The data will be implemented into a database we create for organization.  

To get an idea of the type of data we should build. We will perform research on car sales to see what kind of information 
is important to consider. 

### Deliverable and Demonstration


At the live demo we will be able to do the following: 
- Input data from an outside file.  
- Show that the data is neatly contained withr in our database.
- Use the data to generate a detailed 3D visual representation. 
- Display the results of some statistical anaysis visually. 
- It will be interactive.

## Work Plan and Schedule

This project will be accomplished is steps. The first things that will be worked on is the database and extracting
data from a outside file. Once the data is organized into a database we will work on finding ways to display that data
graphically through the plot library. Then we will work on different relevant statistical analysis functions to discover 
cool things about the data. Once the math is done we will look at ways to also display that data. 

### First Milestone (04-13)
What exactly will be turned in on this day?

- code that accomplishes pulling in data from an outside file.
- code that accomplishes organizing that data into a database.

### Second Milestone (04-21)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

- code that accomplishes mathmatical computation of data.
- code that accomplishes displaying results graphically.


## Group Responsibilities

### Ryan Cauble
will write the code that creates the database and the code that generates the results visually.

### Cody Mulkern
will write the code that extracts data from an outside file and the code that computes the data mathmatically.

## Proposal Presentations
Create your 2- to 3-slide presentation in [Google Slides][gslides]. Then, import them into one of the two slide decks:

* [Martin section][martinslides]
* [Sherman section][shermanslides]
