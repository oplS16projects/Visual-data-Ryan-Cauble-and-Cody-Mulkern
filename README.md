# Visual-data-Ryan-Cauble-and-Cody-Mulkern



### Evaluation of Results
How will you know if you are successful? 
If you include some kind of _quantitative analysis,_ that would be good.

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.


### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
What additionally will be done in the last chunk of time?

# FP4-proposal

# Project Title: Visual Data
### Problem Statement
When looking at large amounts of data it is sometimes hard to visualize the big picture of whats really going on. 
Lets pretend that you own a car dealership and want to know what months typically have the largest sales. To find out
the answer to this many years of car sales would need to be analysed. This task would be daunting to accomplish without
the help from some clever software. This is interesting because the concept can be applied to many real life situations
where data needs to analysed and viewed graphically to be understood.  

### Problem Analysis
To accomplish this project many concepts from class will be used together to organize, calculate, and display our data.
- A database will be used to store and organize the data that will be used. 
- Mathmatical procedures will be writting to perform the statistcal computation. 
- The plot library will be used to display the data stored in the database. 
- Other methods will be written to import data from an outside file that will be used to fill database. 
- We will be using a combination of methods from in class to accomplish all of this. 

### Data set or other source materials
The data we use will come from a file like a excel sheet we create. This file will simulate the data that could be received 
from other sources like the internet. For building and testing purposes we need the data to be fixed and predictable so that is why 
we decided to create our own data set.

The data will be implemented into a database we create for organization.  

To get an idea of the type of data we should build. We will perform research on car sales to see what kind of information 
is important to consider. 

### Deliverable and Demonstration


At the live demo we will be able to do the following: 
- Input data from an outside file.  
- Show that the data is neatly contained within our database.
- Use the data to generate a detailed 3D visual representation. 
- Display the results of some statistical anaysis visually. 
- It will be interactive.

## Work Plan and Schedule

This project will be accomplished is steps. The first things that will be worked on is the database and extracting
data from a outside file. Once the data is organized into a database we will work on finding ways to display that data
graphically through the plot library. Then we will work on different relevant statistical analysis functions to discover 
cool things about the data. Once the math is done we will look at ways to also display that data. 

### First Milestone (04-13)
What exactly will be turned in on this day?

- code that accomplishes pulling in data from an outside file.
- code that accomplishes organizing that data into a database.

### Second Milestone (04-21)
What exactly will be turned in on this day? 

- code that accomplishes mathmatical computation of data.
- code that accomplishes displaying results graphically.


## Group Responsibilities

### Ryan Cauble
will write the code that creates the database and the code that generates the results visually.

### Cody Mulkern
will write the code that extracts data from an outside file and the code that computes the data mathmatically.

## Proposal Presentations
Create your 2- to 3-slide presentation in [Google Slides][gslides]. Then, import them into one of the two slide decks:

* [Martin section][martinslides]
* [Sherman section][shermanslides]
